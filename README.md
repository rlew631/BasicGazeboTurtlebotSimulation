# BasicGazeboTurtlebotSimulation
Motion and camera commands for the wafflepi turtlebot

The python code is used to perform several movements, take a picture and repeat. The video of the simulation can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKp_utqyR3s

The photos in this repository show the output displayed to the console as well as one of the pictures that the turtlebot took while operating in the gazebo environment

NOTE! The wafflepi is the only turtlebot that has a usable camera in the gazebo simulation. The other turtlebots will appear to have a camera when looking at rosnode but they are not available for use and rviz will throw an error if trying to view the camera making it look like a configuration issue.
